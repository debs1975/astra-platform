# Here are effective prompts and best practices for deploying Azure Container Apps with Docker images from Azure Container Registry, granting secure access to Blob Storage and SQL Server

### Effective prompts and best practices for deploying Azure Container Apps from ACR and granting secure access to Blob Storage and Azure SQL
## Modular repository layout and full documentation
### Naming convention (required)
**Scope change — Azure SQL removed (temporary)**

- Azure SQL Server / logical database is removed from scope for now. Do not generate XRDs, Compositions, tests, overlays, CI steps, or docs that reference Azure SQL.
- Deprecate the canonical short-name for SQL (do not add or use the `sql` short-name in new modules or overlays).
- Update parameter lists and overlays to remove SQL-related inputs (db name, admin credentials, PITR settings, sql connection outputs).
- Remove any outputs, secret mappings, role assignments, or Key Vault entries that were specific to SQL; keep Key Vault usage for remaining secrets only.
- Update the repo checklist and docs to reflect SQL removal and note how/where SQL will be re-introduced if needed.
- Confirm whether you want:
    1) to delete existing packages/azuresql/ and related overlays/tests, or  
    2) to keep the folder but mark it archived/deprecated with a deprecation notice in docs.

Please confirm which cleanup option you prefer.
Use: astra-<environment>-<short-resource-name>(-<optional-suffix>)

Rules
- environment: canonical identifiers — dev, staging, prod, qa (lowercase).
- short-resource-name: 3–5 lowercase letters that identify the resource type (examples below).
- Use only lowercase letters, hyphen separators, and optional short alphanumeric suffixes for instance indexes.
- Prefer separate parameterization for instance indexes rather than encoding long suffixes into the base name.

Validation regex (recommended)
- ^astra-(dev|staging|prod|qa)-[a-z]{3,5}(-[a-z0-9]+)?$

Canonical short-name examples
- rg → astra-dev-rg
- acr → astra-dev-acr
- kv → astra-dev-kv
- cae → astra-dev-cae
- app → astra-dev-app
- sta → astra-dev-sta
- sql → astra-dev-sql
- mi → astra-dev-mi

Azure DevOps enforcement (recommended)
- Add a pipeline job (e.g., name-lint) that runs a simple script to scan changed manifests and fail the build on any name that does not match the regex.
- Example approach:
    1. In the PR pipeline, enumerate changed YAML files.
    2. Extract resource name fields (e.g., metadata.name) and test them against the regex.
    3. Fail the job with a clear message listing offending names and file locations.
- Keep the pipeline step fast and deterministic so PRs are blocked early on naming violations.

Governance
- Maintain a central list of allowed short-names (module README and a CI-checked file). Require PRs that add or change short-names to update that central list and pass CI validation.
- Document the naming policy in each package's docs.md and include examples for overlays and composition outputs.
- Use the namingPrefix parameter (e.g., namingPrefix: astra-dev) and per-resource short-name parameterization in XRDs to ensure deterministic names and to make CI validation straightforward.
- Ensure error messages from CI are actionable (file, line, offending name, and expected pattern).
- <environment>: canonical identifiers (dev, staging, prod, qa). Keep lowercase.
- <short-resource-name>: 3–5 lowercase letters that identify the resource type (examples below).

Example canonical short-names:
- Resource Group: rg → astra-dev-rg
- ACR: acr → astra-dev-acr
- Key Vault: kv → astra-dev-kv
- Container Apps Environment: cae → astra-dev-cae
- Container App (app instance suffix): app → astra-dev-app
- Storage Account (logical short): sta → astra-dev-sta
- Azure SQL logical name: sql → astra-dev-sql
- Managed identity: mi → astra-dev-mi

Recommended patterns and validation
- Enforce lowercase, hyphen separators, and short-name length 3–5.
- Suggested regex for CI/schema validation: ^astra-(dev|staging|prod|qa)-[a-z]{3,5}(-[a-z0-9]+)?$
    - The optional trailing segment allows a short extra suffix where needed (e.g., astra-dev-acr-01), but prefer separate parameterization for instance indexes.
- Validate names in XRD schema with pattern properties and provide clear error messages.

Parameterization guidance
- Expose a namingPrefix parameter that holds astra-<environment> (e.g., namingPrefix: astra-dev).
- Expose a resourceSuffix or resourceType parameter that supplies the 3–5 letter short name per resource.
- Example XRD usage:
    - namingPrefix: astra-dev
    - resourceTypeSuffix: acr
    - computed resource name: {{ .spec.namingPrefix }}-{{ .spec.resourceTypeSuffix }} → astra-dev-acr

CI & Governance
- Add a lint step in CI (YAML linter or custom script) that validates all resource names against the regex and rejects PRs that include non-conforming names.
- Document allowed short-names per module in the module README and in the module's parameter validation (XRD schema enum or pattern).

Documentation note
- List canonical short-names and any exceptions in each package/docs.md so consumers reuse the same short-name set and avoid collisions.
- Require PRs that add new short-names to update the central naming checklist and CI validation rules.
### Purpose
Describe a modular, opinionated directory structure and conventions for Crossplane-first IaC that provisions Azure Container Apps from ACR, Key Vault, Storage, and Azure SQL. Emphasize modularity, parameterization, least-privilege, GitOps, and reproducible promotion across environments.

---

## Goals
- Keep one concern per package/module.
- Make components composable and testable.
- Keep secrets out of Git and surface only references.
- Support environment overlays (dev/stage/prod) and CompositionRevision promotion.
- Provide clear CI/CD and GitOps flows.

## Module-level layout (example `packages/containerapp`)
- xrd/
    - compositecontainerapp.yaml        # XRD schema + validation
- composition/
    - composition-v1-0-0.yaml
    - composition-v1-1-0.yaml
    - patches-and-transforms.yaml
- kustomize/ or helm/                  # optional templating for local tests

    - e2e.sh
- docs.md                              # module purpose, parameters, RBAC, upgrade notes

Each package is a single logical boundary (one concern). Keep compositions small and focused.

---

## Naming conventions
- Resource group: astra-dev-rg
- Prefix pattern: astra-dev-<resource>-<env>-<suffix>
- Container App environment: astra-dev-cae-<env>
- ACR: astra-dev-acr-<env>
- Key Vault: astra-dev-kv-<env>
Document canonical examples per module and require a namingPrefix parameter.

---

## Parameterization & overlays
- Expose minimal, explicit inputs on each XRD: namingPrefix, location, sku, networkIds, subnetIds, secretsRefName, providerConfigRef.
- Keep environment-specific values in overlays/ENV/values.yaml and reference them from GitOps pipeline.
- Overlays should NOT contain secrets. Use secretRef names that align with external secret operator or Key Vault.

Example overlay variables to supply per environment:
- subscriptionId
- location
- namingPrefix
- providerConfigRef
- network.vnetId
- network.subnetIds
- sku.tier

---

## Secrets, Key Vault & Secret Sync
- Store all sensitive credentials in Key Vault.
- Crossplane Compositions should reference Key Vault secrets via ExternalSecret pattern or KeyVault CSI — do not embed secrets in Composition manifests.
- Map important outputs (SQL connection secret name, ACR push credentials if any, KV URI) to Kubernetes Secret refs but keep those refs non-sensitive where possible.
- Document exact Key Vault RBAC entries required for the Crossplane service principal to read secrets (least privilege).

---

## Identities & RBAC
- Create dedicated managed identities per composite resource where needed.
- Assign AcrPull to the Container App identity scoped to the ACR resource.
- Use well-scoped RoleAssignment resources inside Composition manifest (not wide subscription roles).
- Document role names, scopes, and minimal permission sets required for each identity.

---

## Networking
- Provide parameters for using existing VNets/subnets or creating new ones.
- Prefer PrivateEndpoints for Storage and SQL. Document required DNS/private endpoint configuration and how to inject private endpoint NICs into the shared VNet.
- Document how to configure Container Apps Environment with VNet integration.

---

## GitOps & Promotion
- All Crossplane packages are versioned under packages/.
- Compose a promotion flow:
    1. Developer creates PR to packages/<module> and bump CompositionRevision.
    2. CI builds and runs composition tests.
    3. Merge triggers publishing package artifact (GitHub Packages or OCI registry).
    4. Overlays reference package versions. Promote by updating overlays/ENV/kustomization.yaml to new package version via PR.
- Document rollback steps: revert overlay version and re-apply; describe recovery for resource recreation vs. in-place updates.

---

## CI / CD recommendations
- CI jobs should:
    - Validate YAML schemas and XRD validation.
    - Run composition unit tests (composition test harness).
    - Lint for secrets in manifests.
    - Build Crossplane package artifact and publish to registry.
- CD (GitOps) should:
    - Be read-only for packages; overlays trigger environment deploys.
    - Use GitHub Actions with OIDC for publishing and Flux/Argo for environment deployments.
- Keep secrets out of CI logs. Fetch runtime secrets via Key Vault or GitHub Actions secrets.

---

## Testing & Validation
- Unit test compositions with a composition test harness.
- Provide lightweight e2e test using ephemeral cluster that installs the package and asserts:
    - XRD schema acceptance
    - Composition creates resources with expected tags/naming
    - Identity role assignments exist
    - Private endpoints and DNS resolve
- Include automated cleanup in tests.

---

## Backups & Recovery
- Document SQL automated backup settings (PITR).
- Document Key Vault secret rotation strategy and how to rotate managed identities/role assignments with minimal disruption.
- Provide deletion policies in compositions where safe; document manual recovery steps where resources are intentionally immutable.

---

## Documentation files to include per module
- docs.md: purpose, parameters, example overlays, required providerConfig, expected outputs, RBAC, networking notes.
- README.md: quick start and example apply steps.
- upgrade-notes.md: breaking changes and CompositionRevision promotion instructions.
- checklist.md: pre-deploy checks and post-deploy validations.

---

## Updated prompt templates (include modular directory request)
- "Generate a Crossplane package in packages/containerapp that creates: Resource Group, Container Apps Environment (with VNet), Container App (system-assigned identity), ACR, Key Vault, Storage Account with private endpoint, and Azure SQL. Parameterize namingPrefix, region, sku, networkIds, subnetIds, and providerConfigRef. Produce XRDs under packages/containerapp/xrd, Compositions under packages/containerapp/composition, tests under packages/containerapp/tests, and docs under packages/containerapp/docs.md. Map outputs to secret refs and include a sample overlay in overlays/dev that consumes the package. Ensure least-privilege role assignments and package versioning."
- "Create a module skeleton for packages/azuresql with XRD, Composition, minimal tests, and docs. Add an overlays/example manifest in overlays/dev showing providerConfigRef and namingPrefix. Include a sample GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/package.yml) that validates YAML, runs composition tests, and publishes the Crossplane package artifact."
- "Produce an overlays/* layout: overlays/dev, overlays/staging, overlays/prod. Each overlay must include providerconfig reference, values.yaml, and a kustomization that references specific Crossplane package versions. Provide a promotion checklist to move package versions from dev→staging→prod."

---

## Checklist (apply & review)
- [ ] ProviderConfig per environment exists and is referenced.
- [ ] XRD parameters validated with safe defaults.
- [ ] Secrets stored in Key Vault; no secrets in Git.
- [ ] RoleAssignments scoped to resource-level roles only.

---

## Final notes for prompt authors
- Always ask for: existing VNet IDs, subscriptionId, naming prefix, and providerConfigRef when generating modules.
- Request explicit environment overlays and where packages should be placed in the repo.
- Ask whether the team prefers Key Vault CSI, ExternalSecrets, or SealedSecrets for secret sync so prompts generate the correct secret wiring.

Use this documentation as the authoritative reference inserted into the prompts section and to guide generation of Crossplane packages, overlays, CI workflows, and promotion procedures.
Add Crossplane-based IaC guidance and prompt templates for modular, parameterized Azure resources

Recommended Crossplane patterns (high level)
- Adopt Crossplane Provider Azure and design Composite Resource Definitions (XRDs) for each logical service boundary (e.g., CompositeContainerAppEnvironment, CompositeContainerApp, CompositeACR, CompositeKeyVault, CompositeStorageAccount, CompositeAzureSQL) — keep one concern per XRD.
- Create a Composition per XRD that composes managed Azure resources (resource group, managed identity, role assignments, private endpoints, etc.). Keep compositions small and focused so replacements/updates are isolated.
- Parameterize Compositions: expose only necessary inputs (names, regions, SKU, network IDs, secretsRef names). Use patches and composition-level transforms to map inputs to composed resources.
- Use CompositionRevision and package compositions as Crossplane Packages for versioned deployments; promote revisions through environments (dev → staging → prod).
- Use ProviderConfig to centralize provider credentials; prefer workload identities and short-lived credentials. Avoid embedding Azure credentials in Compositions.
- Map important runtime outputs (ACR loginServer, Container App URL, KeyVault URI, storage endpoint, SQL connection secret) to Kubernetes Secret connection refs from the composite resource for downstream consumers.
- Use Crossplane-managed Kubernetes SecretRef for non-sensitive configuration and integrate with an External Secret operator (ExternalSecrets, SealedSecrets, or Azure Key Vault CSI) for secret synchronization and centralization.

Security & least privilege
- Grant resource-level privileges via role assignments inside Compositions (AcrPull for Container App identity, Storage Blob Data Reader/Contributor, SQL roles). Prefer managed identities created and controlled by Crossplane.
- Create dedicated managed identities per workload (or per environment) rather than reusing a single identity across many apps.
- Use PrivateEndpoint resources in compositions for Storage and SQL where possible and wire them into a shared VNet/peered networks.
- Keep secrets out of Git; instruct Crossplane to reference secrets stored in Key Vault (or use ExternalSecrets) and only materialize them into cluster Secrets when strictly necessary.

Centralized parameter management & environment design
- Keep environment-specific configuration outside Compositions: use a small “parameter overlay” for each environment (dev/stage/prod) as Kubernetes manifest sets consumed by GitOps (Flux/Argo). These overlays supply Composition inputs (e.g., location, sizing, network IDs).
- Centralize common parameters (naming convention, location, tags, subscription id, common VNet IDs) in a single ConfigMap/Secret per environment or in a GitOps values file. Reference those values when instantiating composite resources.
- Use ProviderConfig references per environment/tenant so credentials and subscription targeting are explicit and auditable.
- Use GitOps pipelines to promote parameter changes and CompositionRevisions; require PRs and review for production changes.

Operational best practices for Crossplane modules
- Design Compositions to be idempotent and safe for updates (use stable immutable names where appropriate, avoid recreating resources on small changes).
- Emit clear connection secrets and output metadata to the composite resource status and mapped secrets so downstream consumers (apps, CI/CD) can consume them reliably.
- Add validation markers in XRD schema for required params and use Composition patches to supply defaults when not provided.
- Keep resource naming deterministic (follow astra-dev-<resource>-<env>-suffix) and expose name templates as parameters.
- Add automated tests for Compositions (e.g., Composition test harness or ephemeral test clusters) to validate provisioning and teardown.
- Use Composition-level RBAC to ensure Crossplane service account has only required permissions per environment and rotate credentials regularly.

Prompt templates to generate Crossplane modules & workflows
- "Generate a Crossplane package (XRD + Composition + CompositionRevision) that provisions: Resource Group, Container Apps Environment (with VNet), Container App (system-assigned managed identity), ACR, Key Vault, Storage Account with private endpoint, and Azure SQL. Parameterize region, naming prefix, sku sizes, and VNet/subnet IDs. Expose outputs for ACR loginServer, Container App URL, Key Vault URI, and SQL connection secret. Ensure each composed resource follows least-privilege role assignments and uses managed identities created by Crossplane."
- "Create a Crossplane Composition that assigns AcrPull to the Container App identity scoped to the ACR resource. Parameterize the identity name and ACR scope. Map the resulting identity principalId into the composite resource status and connection Secret."
- "Produce an environment overlay pattern using GitOps: one values file per environment that provides centralized parameters (naming prefix, location, subscription id, VNet ids). Demonstrate how to instantiate the composite resources using those values and how to promote CompositionRevisions between environments."
- "Write a CI job (GitHub Actions) that: 1) packages the Crossplane Composition into a package installable on a cluster, 2) performs basic schema validation and Composition tests, and 3) applies environment-specific overlays via Flux or kubectl to a dev cluster. Keep secrets out of the pipeline and fetch them via Azure Key Vault or GitHub Secrets where needed."

Checklist items to include in generated modules/prompts
- Provide a ProviderConfig and document how to switch between environment ProviderConfigs.
- Validate and document all XRD parameters and supply safe defaults.
- Make all sensitive values secret-backed (do not put secrets directly into the Composition manifests).
- Use well-scoped RoleAssignment managed resources rather than wide subscription roles.
- Ensure compositions include deletion policies where appropriate and document recovery steps.
- Output clear instructions on how to rotate credentials, update roles, and promote CompositionRevisions.

Small sample language to add in the prompts section
- "Generate Crossplane XRDs and Compositions that follow the astra-dev naming conventions, expose a minimal set of parameters, centralize environment parameters in a single overlay per environment, and produce well-known connection Secrets and outputs for downstream consumption. Include documentation and CompositionRevision promotion guidance."

Use these additions to convert existing ACR / Container App prompts into Crossplane-first IaC prompts that enforce modular resource patterns, centralized environment parameterization, least-privilege RBAC, and GitOps-friendly packaging.
- Create a resource group for the Azure Services
- The naming convention should be astra-dev-rg where rg stands for resource group.
- Follow similar naming convention for rest of the resources

Recommended approaches

- Use managed identities (system- or user-assigned) for Container Apps to access ACR, Blob Storage, and Azure SQL — avoid embedding credentials.
- Store secrets (connection strings, admin credentials) in Azure Key Vault and grant only the identity least privilege to read needed secrets.
- Give ACR access by assigning the Container App identity the AcrPull role on the registry (no admin account).
- Use Azure AD authentication for Azure SQL (Managed Identity + contained database users) instead of SQL auth where possible.
- Use Private Endpoints or service endpoints for Blob Storage and SQL to restrict network exposure; enable firewall rules.
- Centralize logs and metrics to Log Analytics; enable container probes (liveness/readiness) and resource requests/limits.
- Automate builds & deployments with CI/CD (GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps). Push immutable image tags and scan images (Aqua/Trivy/Microsoft Defender).

Short checklist (infrastructure & security)
- Create Container Apps Environment with required VNet configuration (if private endpoints needed).
- Build & push image to ACR (use GitHub Actions with OIDC or service principal).
- Assign AcrPull to Container App identity for the ACR resource scope.
- Create Key Vault; store DB and storage connection info; grant Key Vault access via identity.
- Configure Container App secrets via Key Vault references or mount for runtime.
- Configure Managed Identity-based access to Blob Storage (role: Storage Blob Data Reader/Contributor as needed).
- Enable Azure SQL firewall/private endpoint; create Azure AD user for the managed identity.
- Enable diagnostic settings to Log Analytics and configure alerting.

Concise prompt templates for generating IaC or deployment steps
- "Generate a Crossplane module that creates an Azure Container App environment, a Container App, an ACR, and assigns AcrPull to a system-assigned identity. Include Key Vault and a storage account with private endpoint. Add outputs for ACR login server and Container App URL."
- "Create a GitHub Actions workflow that builds a Docker image, pushes to ACR using OIDC, and deploys an Azure Container App using az cli. Use environment variables and Key Vault references for secrets."
- "Produce an Azure CLI script to: 1) register managed identity on an existing Container App, 2) grant AcrPull on a given ACR, 3) assign Storage Blob Data Contributor on a storage container, and 4) set up Azure AD authentication for SQL for that identity."

Best-practice tips for prompts to LLMs
- Provide explicit resource names, regions, and existing dependencies (VNet, resource group).
- Request idempotent IaC (Crossplane/Terraform) with variables/parameters and clear outputs.
- Ask for secure defaults: disable ACR admin user, enable HTTPS-only on storage, enforce TLS for SQL, and set least-privilege RBAC.
- Ask for comments explaining security choices and how to rotate credentials or update roles.

Operational & maintenance notes
- Use image tags with digest promotion (avoid latest in production).
- Periodically review RBAC and key rotation in Key Vault.
- Enable scanning and policy enforcement (Azure Policy/CIS) for container registries and images.
- Test failover and backup for SQL; keep automated backups and point-in-time restore configured.

Use these prompts and checklist items to generate concrete IaC, scripts, and CI/CD workflows while following the secure patterns above.
