## Diagram Usage Guidelines

### Viewing Diagrams
All diagrams are written in Mermaid syntax and will render automatically in:
- GitHub markdown viewers
- GitLab markdown viewers
- VS Code with Mermaid preview extensions
- Documentation sites using Mermaid plugins

### Diagram Color Scheme
The diagrams use a consistent color scheme aligned with Azure branding:

| Color | Hex Code | Usage |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Azure Blue | `#0078D4` | Azure services, ingress |
| Kubernetes Blue | `#326CE5` | Crossplane, Kubernetes components |
| Green | `#7FBA00` | Success states, resource groups |
| Yellow/Gold | `#FFB900` | Identity, authentication |
| Purple | `#8661C5` | Container Apps, applications |
| Red | `#E74856` | Key Vault, security components |

### Editing Diagrams
To edit diagrams:
1. Locate the diagram in the markdown file
2. Edit the Mermaid code block
3. Preview using a Mermaid-compatible viewer
4. Test rendering in your target platform

### Adding New Diagrams
When adding new diagrams:
1. Follow the existing color scheme
2. Use clear, descriptive labels
3. Keep diagrams focused on one concept
4. Add diagram reference to this index
5. Include diagram title and location in documentation
